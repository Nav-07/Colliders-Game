# Colliders 
Colliders is a C++ and SDL2 Based Weekend Project created just for fun, the player basically is controlling a paddle using his/her keyboard and his gaol is to collide with the square objects falling from the top. Some advantages of making this project are:

1. I would finally complete a project.
2. I would get experience with class management and prepare myself for complex game jams.
3. It's Fun, I get to code and play games at the same time.

This project is going to be written entirely in C++ and SDL2 and is going to use makefile instead of XCode or any other IDE, and since I love to use a Text Editor rather than an IDE it would be even more fun, I am pretty excited for this one, coz it's night time and I love to dream what I would do in the morning, so yeah, let's go, wish me luck and let's get ready for a heavy-coding morning.

## Current Progress
I have been working on this project for the last 2 hours and the progress is actually pretty good, I was able to generate a SDL2 project without using any IDE, created some basic source code stuff and created the basic rendering engine for this project, now I was working on joining the pieces together, the logic behind the loop, etc. and would start working on the collision detection tonight or tomorrow morning I don't know, see ya.
